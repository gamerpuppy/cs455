I do not have a run.sh script, but the program should work correctly when started with such a script or manually.

Logging is displayed by default in the registry and off in the messaging nodes
this can be changed in the main method of each by changing the lines
    Logger.logLevel = Logger.LOG_LEVEL_<ON or OFF>
